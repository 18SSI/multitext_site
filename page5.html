      <h2>Diary Entry</h2><br>

October 12<br>
Ellie<br>
The house is kinda messier lately. There’s stuff on the counters and laundry on the couch. Mom still packs my lunch, though. She always cuts the crust off.<br>
<br>
Tonight I asked what was for dinner, and Mom said, Ask your dad. He’s cooking. I’ve never had Dad’s cooking before. He made pasta. It was okay, but I like Mom’s way better. His sauce was kinda watery. <br>
He didn’t know where the strainer was, and I had to help him find it. <br>
<br>
Mom didn’t say anything. She just ate and looked out the window a lot. After dinner, she didn’t clean the table right away. She sat down first. That almost never happens. She didn’t look mad. Just quiet. She’s been like that a lot. Not yelling or anything. Just not talking as much. Like she’s thinking a lot in her head. She went outside again, standing by the willow tree  in the yard. She just stood there, looking up. Not doing anything. Not even on her phone. It was weird. <br>
