The willow tree stands as a monument to silent endurance; its drooping branches, shaped by unseen burdens, mirror the emotional weight carried by generations of women. As a motif, the willow embodies the societal expectation of feminine resilience: bending under the pressure of domestic labour, childcare, and career sacrifices without complaint, yet never permitted to break. This multi-text, The Weight of the Willow, confronts the normalization of the household chores women bear. Exposing how the weight of expectations can cause exhaustion and stress. Just as the Willow’s graceful arc conceals its struggle against relentless storms, society overlooks the crushing mental load shouldered by women planning, anticipating, and holding households together while their own needs crumble.
Sarah, a working mother balancing corporate deadlines and domestic chaos, anchors this narrative. Her story unfolds through fragmented moments of crisis: mornings spent packing lunches while responding to work emails, text exchanges with her mother who dismisses her burnout as just motherhood, and a kitchen confrontation with her husband, David. His weaponized incompetence "You’re better at this stuff" ignites Sarah’s realization that her sacrifices have created space for his indifference. The willow in her yard, bending then fracturing in a storm, mirrors her breaking point. Through her daughter Ellie’s diary, we witness the fallout: a home in disarray, watery pasta cooked by a clueless father, and Sarah’s silent vigils beneath the tree not praying, but simply for space.
The Willow’s duality (beauty/suffering) permeates every piece. The interactive game, where players race against time to complete maternal tasks, replicates Sarah’s mental load. Playing a video game is often seen as the opposite of working, something effortless or unimportant. In a similar way, the work women do in the home is viewed as "just what they do" rather than actual hard work. Their work goes unappreciated, so I made the work they do into a video game to highlight this comparison. Ellie’s diary entry observes Sarah’s withdrawal, framing generational change through a child’s confusion. The poem "Bend" entwines Sarah and the willow in shared dignity: "A figure bent, but dignified... She wasn’t free but she could be." Text messages with Sarah’s mother echo cultural gaslighting, while the kitchen script lays bare systemic inequity in dialogue. Together, these pieces make the unseen seen. After which I can ask the reader at what point will a willow stop bending?
