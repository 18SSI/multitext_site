      <p style="color: #9caf8f;">Characters:
Sarah – Stressed out from her workload.<br>
David – Her husband, well-meaning but it's almost as if he's using weaponized incompetence to get out of chores.<br>
Setting:
Evening. The kitchen is cluttered but functional. School papers, a laptop, and a half-prepared dinner are scattered across the counters. Distant sounds of a television in the other room. Light from the window catches the movement of a tree outside.
(SARAH is on the stove, stirring something in a pan. Her phone buzzes. She glances at it but doesn’t check. DAVID enters, holding his phone and half-finished laundry.)<br>
DAVID<br>
Hey, do you want me to start the laundry, or—<br>
SARAH<br>
(speaking over him)<br>
Can you just do dinner tonight? I’ve got a call in half an hour and I haven’t even—<br>
DAVID<br>
(interrupting, shrugging)<br>
Yeah, I mean, suree. But… you’re just better at this stuff. You know, cooking, planning, all that.<br>
(SARAH stops stirring. Sets the spoon down.)<br>
SARAH<br>
I’m better at it because I have to be. Not because I want to be!<br>
DAVID<br>
It’s not a criticism. I just mean you’re organized. I’d probably mess it up.<br>
SARAH<br>
Exactly. You don’t try because you assume I’ll fix it.<br>
DAVID<br>
Come on. That’s not fair. I help. I work too. I make more money doesn’t that count?<br>
SARAH<br>
(staring at him)<br>
You make more because I gave up promotions, shifts, and chances so someone could be here. So someone could remember what the kids need. So someone could manage everything else.<br>
DAVID<br>
We both made choices.<br>
SARAH<br>
No. I made space so you didn’t have to.<br>
(Beat. Silence hangs in the air. SARAH turns away, and pushes the pan off the burner.)<br>
SARAH<br>
Do you know what it feels like to be needed by everyone but supported by no one?<br>
(A child’s voice yells from the other room. Something crashes. SARAH flinches, and closes her eyes.)<br>
DAVID<br>
You’re making this into something bigger—<br>
SARAH<br>
(biting back)<br>
Because it is something bigger.<br>
(She takes her keys from the counter. Moves toward the door.)<br>
SARAH<br>
I’m stepping outside. Figure out dinner.<br>
(She exits toward the willow tree outside)<br>
